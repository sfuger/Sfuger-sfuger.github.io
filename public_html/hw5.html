<p> <span style="font-size:2em;">P</span>olka dot is a pattern consisting of an array of large filled circles of the same size. Polka dots are commonly seen on children's clothing, toys, furniture, ceramics, and Eastern European folk art but they appear in a wide array of contexts. The pattern rarely appears in formal contexts, however, and is generally confined to more playful attire such as bathing suits and lingerie. Occasionally, white-on-black small dots appear on more formal clothing.</p>
<p><span style= "font-size:1.5em;">S </span>ome people associate polka dots with Venezuelan fashion designer Carolina Herrera, who used polka dots on most of her dresses during the late 1980s and early 1990s, as well as on the boxes of perfume Carolina Herrera, Herrera For Men, Aquaflore and Flore. Much of the Japanese artist's Yayoi Kusama's work features a polka dot motif.</p>

<p>STRIPES! As a pattern (more than one stripe together), stripes are commonly seen in nature, food, emblems, clothing, and elsewhere. 

<p>Two-toned stripes inherently draw one's attention, and as such are used to signal hazards. They are used in road signs, barricade tape, and thresholds.</p>

<p>In nature, as with the zebra, stripes may have developed through natural selection to produce motion dazzle.Tigers also have stripes that help them blend into their surroundings.</p>

<p>Stripes may give appeal to certain sweets like the candy cane. They are alos used to add flavors. Certin types of taffy add flavor their their stripes for an example </p>

<p>Stripes on garment first appeared in the Medieval times. During that era, only prisoners, criminals, clowns, prostitutes, hangmen, etc. were seen wearing a black and white striped garment. However, by the end of the nineteenth century, a new definition of stripes was created by Queen Victoria. The queen dressed her son in a sailor suit during a Royal Yacht boarding event.Stripes were no longer just associated with “someone evil.” Stripes were then connected with words such as “marine” and “sea”. Navy blue and white stripes were adopted by swimmers on their bathing suits. At the beginning of the twentieth century, the stripe fashion became mainstream again. Coco Chanel was inspired by the workers’ uniform during her trip to the French Rivera, and she started to apply the “Navy and White Stripes” into her designs.In the ’50s, movie stars were seen wearing striped shirts through the media. During the ’60s and ’70s, more and more people started to wear striped shirts as the garment was seen as a symbol of rebellion.</p>
